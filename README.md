 # YANA Coffee Shop Website 


Domain:  http://yanacoffeeshop.com

Sign logo text looks like Barlow 800 

 Hours spent: 25


 ## My vision for the pictures that would make this website pop out: 
- A row of colorful drinks
- Workers standing by the sign folding arms
- Interior shots 
    + Capture the feel of the shop
    + Capture the 'cozyness'
- Close up shots of drinks + food
    + Need shots of all sorts of drinks
    + Get clean shots of food
    + Try combinations
- Shots of us at work
    + Maybe close up of just hands and food
- Customer engagement
    + Maybe pictures of cutomers enjoying the food!
- Equiptment and close ups of the process
- Branding elements 
    + Get more brand shots



Where to find us should have picture of shop in background

Introductions should take up a big block to really show who we are

Menu will be in another page

Where to find us will have number and address   "visit us" Will be the title
