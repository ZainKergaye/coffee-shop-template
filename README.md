 ## My vision for the pictures that would make this website pop out: 
- A row of colorful drinks
- Workers standing by the sign folding arms
- Interior shots 
    + Capture the feel of the shop
    + Capture the 'cozyness'
- Close up shots of drinks + food
    + Need shots of all sorts of drinks
    + Get clean shots of food
    + Try combinations
- Shots of us at work
    + Maybe close up of just hands and food
- Customer engagement
    + Maybe pictures of cutomers enjoying the food!
- Equiptment and close ups of the process
- Branding elements 
    + Get more brand shots
